# Fire-Detection
Predicting Fire Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Introduction
In this project, we leverage the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict and detect the presence of fire in images. The goal is to create an efficient and accurate model that can assist in early fire detection, aiding in timely response and prevention.

Dataset
We utilized a diverse dataset containing images with and without fire. The dataset is crucial for training the CNN to recognize patterns associated with fire, ensuring a robust and reliable model.

Convolutional Neural Network Architecture
The CNN architecture plays a pivotal role in the model's performance. We designed a deep neural network with convolutional layers to automatically learn hierarchical features from input images. The architecture consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers for effective feature extraction and classification.

Training Process
The model is trained on the labeled dataset using a supervised learning approach. We split the dataset into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance. During training, the CNN learns to differentiate between images containing fire and those without, adjusting its parameters to optimize predictive accuracy.

Evaluation Metrics
To assess the model's performance, we use evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

Results
After training the CNN, we evaluate its performance on a separate test dataset. The model's ability to accurately predict fire presence is demonstrated through visualizations, confusion matrices, and relevant metrics.

Usage
To utilize the fire prediction model, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies (Python, TensorFlow, etc.).
Use the provided scripts to preprocess images and train the CNN.
Apply the trained model to new images for fire prediction.
Future Improvements
This project is a starting point, and there's always room for improvement. Future enhancements may include fine-tuning the model, incorporating real-time predictions, and expanding the dataset for increased diversity.

Conclusion
Predicting fire using CNNs is a significant step towards enhancing fire detection capabilities. This project aims to contribute to the field of computer vision for fire prevention and response.
